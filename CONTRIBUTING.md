# 🤝 Contributing to Framely – Mega DevOps AKS Project

Thanks for checking out the **Framely Mega DevOps AKS Project** 🙌

This repository is shared publicly so that others can **learn, explore, and understand** how a real-world DevOps platform can be designed using Kubernetes, GitOps, and modern CI/CD practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Intent

This project is primarily:

* A **personal learning and showcase repository**
* A **hands-on reference** for DevOps concepts
* A place to demonstrate **end-to-end platform design**, not rapid feature development

You are **free to read, clone, fork, and experiment** with this project for learning purposes.

---

## 👤 Maintenance Model

The project is currently:

* Maintained by a **single developer**
* Opinionated by design
* Structured as a **complete and stable reference**

There is no active roadmap or community-driven development at the moment.

---

## 🤗 Using This Repository for Learning

You are encouraged to:

* Clone the repository and explore the structure
* Run the project locally
* Modify things to understand how they work
* Use parts of the setup as reference for your own projects

No permission is required for learning or experimentation.

---

## 💡 Contributions & Feedback

While active contributions are not the primary goal, the following are always welcome:

* Documentation improvements
* Fixing typos or unclear explanations
* Suggestions or questions via GitHub Issues
* General DevOps or architecture feedback

These help improve clarity and learning value.

---

## 🌿 If You Do Contribute Code

If you’d like to submit a change:

* Base your work on the `main` branch
* Keep changes small and focused
* Clearly explain **why** the change is useful

There is **no expectation** of frequent pull requests.

---

## 🔁 CI/CD & GitOps Context (FYI)

This project follows a GitOps model where:

* Jenkins handles CI and Git updates
* ArgoCD applies Kubernetes changes
* Direct Kubernetes deployments are intentionally avoided

You don’t need to fully follow this model for learning,
but changes to the repository should respect its structure.

---

## 🧪 Local Testing (Recommended)

If you plan to modify or extend anything:

* Try to run the project locally
* Ensure basic builds and containers work

Local setup guidance is available here:
📘 `docs/LOCAL-DEV-SETUP.md`

## 🔐 Security Note

Please avoid:

* Committing secrets or credentials
* Adding sensitive data to the repository

If you notice a security concern, feel free to raise it via an Issue.

## 📄 License

This project is licensed under the **MIT License**.

You are free to use it for learning, reference, and personal projects.

## 🏁 Final Note

This repository is meant to be:

* Easy to explore
* Educational
* Realistic, but not intimidating

If it helps you understand DevOps better, then it’s doing its job 🙂
